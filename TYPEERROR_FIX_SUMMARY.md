# TypeError Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was encountering a TypeError when attempting to compare database execution results with integers:
```
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'
```

This occurred because the `databases` library can return `None` from `execute()` calls in some cases, particularly with certain database drivers or configurations.

## Root Cause
The code was directly comparing database execution results with integers without checking for `None`:
```python
result = await database.execute(update_query)
if result > 0:  # ❌ This fails if result is None
```

## Files Fixed

### 1. `backend/services/repo_service.py` (Line 250)
**Before:**
```python
result = await database.execute(update_query)
if result > 0:
```

**After:**
```python
result = await database.execute(update_query)
if result is not None and result > 0:
    # ... success handling
elif result is None:
    # Fallback verification for drivers that return None
    updated_repo = await database.fetch_one(check_query)
    if updated_repo and updated_repo['sync_status'] == sync_status:
        # ... success handling
```

### 2. `backend/services/commit_service.py` (Line 610)
**Before:**
```python
result = await database.execute(query)
return result > 0
```

**After:**
```python
result = await database.execute(query)
return result is not None and result > 0
```

### 3. `backend/services/branch_service.py` (Line 226)
**Before:**
```python
result = await database.execute(query)
return result > 0
```

**After:**
```python
result = await database.execute(query)
return result is not None and result > 0
```

## Solution Details
1. **Added None checks** before all integer comparisons on database execution results
2. **Enhanced repo_service** with a verification fallback when result is None
3. **Maintained backward compatibility** - all functions still return the same boolean values
4. **Comprehensive fix** - addressed all instances of this pattern in the codebase

## Testing
- Created verification script to confirm fixes are in place
- All database operations now safely handle None return values
- The original sync error should no longer occur

## Impact
- ✅ Resolves the TypeError in sync operations
- ✅ Makes the application more robust against different database driver behaviors
- ✅ Prevents similar issues in future database operations
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
