# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive system designed to analyze and visualize data related to software development, particularly focusing on GitHub repositories. It integrates a robust backend API, a dynamic frontend user interface, and advanced artificial intelligence models for in-depth analysis.

## Key Components

1.  **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**: Provides the core API services, handles data persistence, and orchestrates interactions with AI models.
2.  **Frontend (React)**: Offers an intuitive web interface for users to interact with the system, visualize data, and configure analyses.
3.  **AI Models (Python/PyTorch/TensorFlow)**: Implements sophisticated machine learning models for tasks such as commit analysis, sentiment analysis, and other data-driven insights.

## Core Functionalities

*   **GitHub Repository Integration**: Connects to GitHub to fetch repository data including commits, branches, issues, and contributors.
*   **Commit Analysis**: Utilizes AI models (e.g., HAN, Multifusion) to analyze commit messages and code changes for various insights.
*   **User and Contributor Analysis**: Provides tools to understand individual and team contributions within a repository.
*   **Data Visualization**: Presents complex analytical data in an easily understandable graphical format on the frontend.
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle a growing amount of data and user requests efficiently.

## Technologies Used

*   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, PostgreSQL (assumed from `db/database.py` and `migrations`)
*   **Frontend**: React, Vite, JavaScript/JSX, CSS
*   **AI**: Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow (based on `ai/model` and `backend/ai` directories), Hugging Face Transformers (potential)
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL (assumed)
*   **Version Control**: Git, GitHub API
