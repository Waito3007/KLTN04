      "text": "add <viewtransition> component (#31975) this will provide the opt-in for using [view transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/view_transition_api) in react. view transitions only trigger for async updates like `starttransition`, `usedeferredvalue`, actions or `<suspense>` revealing from fallback to content. synchronous updates provide an opt-out but also guarantee that they commit immediately which view transitions can't. there's no need to opt-in to view transitions at the \"cause\" side like event handlers or actions. they don't know what ui will change and whether that has an animated transition described. conceptually the `<viewtransition>` component is like a dom fragment that transitions its children in its own isolate/snapshot. the api works by wrapping a dom node or inner component: ```js import {viewtransition} from 'react'; <viewtransition><component /></viewtransition> ``` the default is `name=\"auto\"` which will automatically assign a `view-transition-name` to the inner dom node. that way you can add a view transition to a component without controlling its dom nodes styling otherwise. a difference between this and the browser's built-in `view-transition-name: auto` is that switching the dom nodes within the `<viewtransition>` component preserves the same name so this example cross-fades between the dom nodes instead of causing an exit and enter: ```js <viewtransition>{condition ? <componenta /> : <componentb />}</viewtransition> ``` this becomes especially useful with `<suspense>` as this example cross-fades between skeleton and content: ```js <viewtransition> <suspense fallback={<skeleton />}> <content /> </suspense> </viewtransition> ``` where as this example triggers an exit of the skeleton and an enter of the content: ```js <suspense fallback={<viewtransition><skeleton /></viewtransition>}> <viewtransition><content /></viewtransition> </suspense> ``` managing instances and keys becomes extra important. you can also specify an explicit `name` property for example for animating the same conceptual item from one page onto another. however, best practices is to property namespace these since they can easily collide. it's also useful to add an `id` to it if available. ```js <viewtransition name=\"my-shared-view\"> ``` the model in general is the same as plain `view-transition-name` except react manages a set of heuristics for when to apply it. a problem with the naive view transitions model is that it overly opts in every boundary that *might* transition into transitioning. this is leads to unfortunate effects like things floating around when unrelated updates happen. this leads the whole document to animate which means that nothing is clickable in the meantime. it makes it not useful for smaller and more local transitions. best practice is to add `view-transition-name` only right before you're about to need to animate the thing. this is tricky to manage globally on complex apps and is not compositional. instead we let react manage when a `<viewtransition>` \"activates\" and add/remove the `view-transition-name`. this is also when react calls `startviewtransition` behind the scenes while it mutates the dom. i've come up with a number of heuristics that i think will make a lot easier to coordinate this. the principle is that only if something that updates that particular boundary do we activate it. i hope that one day maybe browsers will have something like these built-in and we can remove our implementation. a `<viewtransition>` only activates if: - if a mounted component renders a `<viewtransition>` within it outside the first dom node, and it is within the viewport, then that viewtransition activates as an \"enter\" animation. this avoids inner \"enter\" animations trigger when the parent mounts. - if an unmounted component had a `<viewtransition>` within it outside the first dom node, and it was within the viewport, then that viewtransition activates as an \"exit\" animation. this avoids inner \"exit\" animations triggering when the parent unmounts. - if an explicitly named `<viewtransition name=\"...\">` is deep within an unmounted tree and one with the same name appears in a mounted tree at the same time, then both are activated as a pair, but only if they're both in the viewport. this avoids these triggering \"enter\" or \"exit\" animations when going between parents that don't have a pair. - if an already mounted `<viewtransition>` is visible and a dom mutation, that might affect how it's painted, happens within its children but outside any nested `<viewtransition>`. this allows it to \"cross-fade\" between its updates. - if an already mounted `<viewtransition>` resizes or moves as the result of direct dom nodes siblings changing or moving around. this allows insertion, deletion and reorders into a list to animate all children. it is only within one dom node though, to avoid unrelated changes in the parent to trigger this. if an item is outside the viewport before and after, then it's skipped to avoid things flying across the screen. - if a `<viewtransition>` boundary changes size, due to a dom mutation within it, then the parent activates (or the root document if there are no more parents). this ensures that the container can cross-fade to avoid abrupt relayout. this can be avoided by using absolutely positioned children. when this can avoid bubbling to the root document, whatever is not animating is still responsive to clicks during the transition. conceptually each dom node has its own default that activates the parent `<viewtransition>` or no transition if the parent is the root. that means that if you add a dom node like `<div><viewtransition><component /></viewtransition></div>` this won't trigger an \"enter\" animation since it was the div that was added, not the viewtransition. instead, it might cause a cross-fade of the parent viewtransition or no transition if it had no parent. this ensures that only explicit boundaries perform coarse animations instead of every single node which is really the benefit of the view transitions model. this ends up working out well for simple cases like switching between two pages immediately while transitioning one floating item that appears on both pages. because only the floating item transitions by default. note that it's possible to add manual `view-transition-name` with css or `style={{ viewtransitionname: 'auto' }}` that always transitions as long as something else has a `<viewtransition>` that activates. for example a `<viewtransition>` can wrap a whole page for a cross-fade but inside of it an explicit name can be added to something to ensure it animates as a move when something relates else changes its layout. instead of just cross-fading it along with the page which would be the default. there's more prs coming with some optimizations, fixes and expanded apis. this first pr explores the above core heuristic. --------- co-authored-by: sebastian \"sebbie\" silbermann <silbermann.sebastian@gmail.com>",

      "text": "[fizz] shorten throttle to hit a specific target metric (#33463) adding throttling or delaying on images, can obviously impact metrics. however, it's all in the name of better actual user experience overall. (note that it's not strictly worse even for metric. often it's actually strictly better due to less work being done overall thanks to batching.) metrics can impact things like search ranking but i believe this is on a curve. if you're already pretty good, then a slight delay won't suddenly make you rank in a completely different category. similarly, if you're already pretty bad then a slight delay won't make it suddenly way worse. it's still in the same realm. it's just one weight of many. i don't think this will make a meaningful practical impact and if it does, that's probably a bug in the weights that will get fixed. however, because there's a race to try to \"make everything green\" in terms of web vitals, if you go from green to yellow only because of some throttling or suspensey images, it can feel bad. therefore this implements a heuristic where if the only reason we'd miss a specific target is because of throttling or suspensey images, then we shorten the timeout to hit the metric. this is a worse user experience because it can lead to extra flashing but feeling good about \"green\" matters too. if you then have another reveal that happens to be the largest contentful paint after that, then that's throttled again so that it doesn't become flashy after that. if you've already missed the deadline then you're not going to hit your metric target anyway. it can affect average but not median. this is mainly about lcp. it doesn't affect fcp since that doesn't have a throttle. if your lcp is the same as your fcp then it also doesn't matter. we assume that `performance.now()`'s zero point starts at the \"start of the navigation\" which makes this simple. even if we used the `performancenavigationtiming` api it would just tell us the same thing. this only implements for fizz since these metrics tend to currently only by tracked for initial loads, but with soft navs tracking we could consider implementing the same for fiber throttles.",

      "text": "drm/msm: temporarily disable stall-on-fault after a page fault when things go wrong, the gpu is capable of quickly generating millions of faulting translation requests per second. when that happens, in the stall-on-fault model each access will stall until it wins the race to signal the fault and then the resume register is written. this slows processing page faults to a crawl as the gpu can generate faults much faster than the cpu can acknowledge them. it also means that all available resources in the smmu are saturated waiting for the stalled transactions, so that other transactions such as transactions generated by the gmu, which shares translation resources with the gpu, cannot proceed. this causes a gmu watchdog timeout, which leads to a failed reset because gx cannot collapse when there is a transaction pending and a permanently hung gpu. on older platforms with qcom,smmu-v2, it seems that when one transaction is stalled subsequent faulting transactions are terminated, which avoids this problem, but the mmu-500 follows the spec here. to work around these problems, disable stall-on-fault as soon as we get a page fault until a cooldown period after pagefaults stop. this allows the gmu some guaranteed time to continue working. we only use stall-on-fault to halt the gpu while we collect a devcoredump and we always terminate the transaction afterward, so it's fine to miss some subsequent page faults. we also keep it disabled so long as the current devcoredump hasn't been deleted, because in that case we likely won't capture another one if there's a fault. after this commit hfi messages still occasionally time out, because the crashdump handler doesn't run fast enough to let the gmu resume, but the driver seems to recover from it. this will probably go away after the hfi timeout is increased. signed-off-by: connor abbott <cwabbott0@gmail.com> reviewed-by: rob clark <robdclark@gmail.com> patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/654891/ signed-off-by: rob clark <robin.clark@oss.qualcomm.com>",

      "text": "make prerendering always non-blocking with fix (#31452) we've previously failed to land this change due to some internal apps seeing infinite render loops due to external store state updates during render. it turns out that since the `renderwasconcurrent` var was moved into the do block, the sync render triggered from the external store check was stuck with a `rootsuspended` `exitstatus`. so this is not unique to sibling prerendering but more generally related to how we handle update to a sync external store during render. we've tested this build against local repros which now render without crashes. we will try to add a unit test to cover the scenario as well. --------- co-authored-by: andrew clark <git@andrewclark.io> co-authored-by: rick hanlon <rickhanlonii@fb.com>",

      "text": "fix ref lifecycles in hidden subtrees (#31379) ## summary we're seeing certain situations in react native development where ref callbacks in `<activity mode=\"hidden\">` are sometimes invoked exactly once with `null` without ever being called with a \"current\" value. this violates the contract for refs because refs are expected to always attach before detach (and to always eventually detach after attach). this is *particularly* bad for refs that return cleanup functions, because refs that return cleanup functions expect to never be invoked with `null`. this bug causes such refs to be invoked with `null` (because since `safelyattachref` was never called, `safelydetachref` thinks the ref does not return a cleanup function and invokes it with `null`). this fix makes use of `offscreensubtreewashidden` in `commitdeletioneffectsonfiber`, similar to how https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/ec52a5698e2dfea7050a0b015f0b79abfb2d81b7 did this for `commitdeletioneffectsonfiber`. ## how did you test this change? we were able to isolate the repro steps to isolate the react native experimental changes. however, the repro steps depend on fast refresh. ``` function callbackref(current) { // called once with `current` as null, upon triggering fast refresh. } <activity mode=\"hidden\"> <view ref={callbackref} />; </activity> ``` ideally, we would have a unit test that verifies this behavior without fast refresh. (we have evidence that this bug occurs without fast refresh in real product implementations. however, we have not successfully deduced the root cause, yet.) this pr currently includes a unit test that reproduces the fast refresh scenario, which is also demonstrated in this codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/hungry-darkness-33wxy7 verified unit tests pass: ``` $ yarn $ yarn test # run with `-r=www-classic` for `enablescopeapi` tests. $ yarn test -r=www-classic ``` verified on the internal react native development branch that the bug no longer repros. --------- co-authored-by: rick hanlon <rickhanlonii@fb.com>",

      "text": "riscv: implement have_dynamic_ftrace_with_call_ops this patch enables support for dynamic_ftrace_with_call_ops on risc-v. this allows each ftrace callsite to provide an ftrace_ops to the common ftrace trampoline, allowing each callsite to invoke distinct tracer functions without the need to fall back to list processing or to allocate custom trampolines for each callsite. this significantly speeds up cases where multiple distinct trace functions are used and callsites are mostly traced by a single tracer. the idea and most of the implementation is taken from the arm64's implementation of the same feature. the idea is to place a pointer to the ftrace_ops as a literal at a fixed offset from the function entry point, which can be recovered by the common ftrace trampoline. we use -fpatchable-function-entry to reserve 8 bytes above the function entry by emitting 2 4 byte or 4 2 byte nops depending on the presence of config_riscv_isa_c. these 8 bytes are patched at runtime with a pointer to the associated ftrace_ops for that callsite. functions are aligned to 8 bytes to make sure that the accesses to this literal are atomic. this approach allows for directly invoking ftrace_ops::func even for ftrace_ops which are dynamically-allocated (or part of a module), without going via ftrace_ops_list_func. we've benchamrked this with the ftrace_ops sample module on spacemit k1 jupiter: without this patch: baseline (linux rivos 6.14.0-09584-g7d06015d936c #3 smp sat mar 29 +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------+ | number of tracers | total time (ns) | per-call average time | |-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------| | relevant | irrelevant | 100000 calls | total (ns) | overhead (ns) | |----------+------------+-----------------+------------+---------------| | 0 | 0 | 1357958 | 13 | - | | 0 | 1 | 1302375 | 13 | - | | 0 | 2 | 1302375 | 13 | - | | 0 | 10 | 1379084 | 13 | - | | 0 | 100 | 1302458 | 13 | - | | 0 | 200 | 1302333 | 13 | - | |----------+------------+-----------------+------------+---------------| | 1 | 0 | 13677833 | 136 | 123 | | 1 | 1 | 18500916 | 185 | 172 | | 1 | 2 | 22856459 | 228 | 215 | | 1 | 10 | 58824709 | 588 | 575 | | 1 | 100 | 505141584 | 5051 | 5038 | | 1 | 200 | 1580473126 | 15804 | 15791 | |----------+------------+-----------------+------------+---------------| | 1 | 0 | 13561000 | 135 | 122 | | 2 | 0 | 19707292 | 197 | 184 | | 10 | 0 | 67774750 | 677 | 664 | | 100 | 0 | 714123125 | 7141 | 7128 | | 200 | 0 | 1918065668 | 19180 | 19167 | +----------+------------+-----------------+------------+---------------+ note: per-call overhead is estimated relative to the baseline case with 0 relevant tracers and 0 irrelevant tracers. with this patch: v4-rc4 (linux rivos 6.14.0-09598-gd75747611c93 #4 smp sat mar 29 +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------+ | number of tracers | total time (ns) | per-call average time | |-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------| | relevant | irrelevant | 100000 calls | total (ns) | overhead (ns) | |----------+------------+-----------------+------------+---------------| | 0 | 0 | 1459917 | 14 | - | | 0 | 1 | 1408000 | 14 | - | | 0 | 2 | 1383792 | 13 | - | | 0 | 10 | 1430709 | 14 | - | | 0 | 100 | 1383791 | 13 | - | | 0 | 200 | 1383750 | 13 | - | |----------+------------+-----------------+------------+---------------| | 1 | 0 | 5238041 | 52 | 38 | | 1 | 1 | 5228542 | 52 | 38 | | 1 | 2 | 5325917 | 53 | 40 | | 1 | 10 | 5299667 | 52 | 38 | | 1 | 100 | 5245250 | 52 | 39 | | 1 | 200 | 5238459 | 52 | 39 | |----------+------------+-----------------+------------+---------------| | 1 | 0 | 5239083 | 52 | 38 | | 2 | 0 | 19449417 | 194 | 181 | | 10 | 0 | 67718584 | 677 | 663 | | 100 | 0 | 709840708 | 7098 | 7085 | | 200 | 0 | 2203580626 | 22035 | 22022 | +----------+------------+-----------------+------------+---------------+ note: per-call overhead is estimated relative to the baseline case with 0 relevant tracers and 0 irrelevant tracers. as can be seen from the above: a) whenever there is a single relevant tracer function associated with a tracee, the overhead of invoking the tracer is constant, and does not scale with the number of tracers which are *not* associated with that tracee. b) the overhead for a single relevant tracer has dropped to ~1/3 of the overhead prior to this series (from 122ns to 38ns). this is largely due to permitting calls to dynamically-allocated ftrace_ops without going through ftrace_ops_list_func. signed-off-by: puranjay mohan <puranjay12@gmail.com> [update kconfig, asm, refactor] signed-off-by: andy chiu <andybnac@gmail.com> tested-by: björn töpel <bjorn@rivosinc.com> link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250407180838.42877-10-andybnac@gmail.com signed-off-by: alexandre ghiti <alexghiti@rivosinc.com> signed-off-by: palmer dabbelt <palmer@dabbelt.com>",

      "text": "during a swipe gesture render a clone offscreen and animate it onscreen (#32500) this is really the essence mechanism of the `useswipetransition` feature. we don't want to immediately switch to the destination state when starting a gesture. the effects remain mounted on the current state. we want the current state to be \"live\". this is important to for example allow a video to keeping playing while starting a swipe (think tiktok/reels) and not stop until you've committed the action. the only thing that can be live is the \"new\" state. therefore we treat the destination as the \"old\" state and perform a reverse animation from there. ideally we could apply the old state to the dom tree, take a snapshot and then revert it back in the mutation of `startviewtransition`. unfortunately, the way `startviewtransition` was designed it always paints one frame of the \"old\" state which would lead this to cause a flicker. to work around this, we need to create a clone of any view transition boundary that might be mutated and then render that offscreen. that way we can render the \"current\" state on screen and the \"destination\" state offscreen for the screenshots. being mutated can be either due to react doing a dom mutation or if a child boundary resizes that causes the parent to relayout. we don't have to do this for insertions or deletions since they only appear on one side. the worst case scenario is that we have to clone the whole root. that's what this first pr implements. we clone the container and if it's not absolutely positioned, we position it on top of the current one. if the container is `document` or `<html>` we instead clone the `<body>` tag since it's the only one we can insert a duplicate of. if the container is deep in the tree we clone just that even though technically we should probably clone the whole document in that case. we just keep the impact smaller. ideally though we'd never hit this case. in fact, if we clone the document we issue a warning (always for now) since you probably should optimize this. in the future i intend to add optimizations when affected view transition boundaries are absolutely positioned since they cannot possibly relayout the parent. this would be the ideal way to use this feature most efficiently but it still works without it. since we render the \"old\" state outside the viewport, we need to then adjust the animation to put it back into the viewport. this is the trickiest part to get right while still preserving any customization of the view transitions done using css. this current approach reapplies all the animations with adjusted keyframes. in the case of an \"exit\" the pseudo-element itself is positioned outside the viewport but since we can't programmatically update the style of the pseudo-element itself we instead adjust all the keyframes to put it back into the viewport. if there is no animation on the group we add one. in the case of an \"update\" the pseudo-element is positioned on the new state which is already inside the viewport. however, the auto-generated animation of the group has a starting keyframe that starts outside the viewport. in this case we need to adjust that keyframe. in the future i might explore a technique that inserts stylesheets instead of mutating the animations. it might be simpler. but whatever hacks work to maximize the compatibility is best.",

      "text": "[protoextras] separate functionality into different headers. this cl significantly changes the behavior of the proto_extras gni template to generate one proto_library per functionality, instead of having all generated functionality exist in one header. furthermore, each functionality only depends on the specific dependencies it needs. the previous behavior was that a single file would be generated (.extras.h/cc) which would contain all of the possible functionality, depending on the set options, and depend on all dependency \"extras\" targets fully. now: 1. serialize is now in <name>.to_value.h/cc 2. streaming operators are now in <name>.ostream.h/cc 3. the `extras_deps` field is added, used to pass the proto_extras target for any dependency protobuf targets. this change is necessary to: - allow code to only include support for a single functionality it needs, instead of all functionality, decreasing build & link times. - address feedback about how having a lot of functionality in one \"utils\" or \"extras\" header can cause scope bloat and dependency issues. - allow the build graph to minimize more per-extras-functionality. bug: 420979908 change-id: ic55b0f72e60635263bc82d7791c614daf7429254 reviewed-on: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6654849 commit-queue: yann dago <ydago@chromium.org> reviewed-by: yann dago <ydago@chromium.org> reviewed-by: daniel rubery <drubery@chromium.org> auto-submit: daniel murphy <dmurph@chromium.org> cr-commit-position: refs/heads/main@{#1477288}",

[palmer: no idea what that branch is, so i'm basing it on the uaccess optimizations patch series which is the last thing to touch these.] * b4-shazam-merge riscv: uaccess: do not do misaligned accesses in get/put_user() riscv: process: use unsigned int instead of unsigned long for put_user() riscv: make unsafe user copy routines use existing assembly routines link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250602193918.868962-1-cleger@rivosinc.com signed-off-by: palmer dabbelt <palmer@dabbelt.com>",
